We demonstrate these properties in continuous-depth residual networks and continuous-time latent variable models. We also construct continuous normalizing flows, a generative model that can train by maximum likelihood, without partitioning or ordering the data dimensions. For training, we show how to scalably backpropagate through any ODE solver, without access to its internal operations. This allows end-to-end training of ODEs within larger models.

Shortly after saving the file, your site will automatically update Read the Quick Start Guide to learn how to add Markdown content. For inspiration, refer to the Markdown content which powers the Demo  Install with Git Prerequisites:\n Download and install Git Download and install Hugo   Fork the Academic Kickstart repository and clone your fork with Git:\ngit clone https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-kickstart.git My_Website  Note that if you forked Academic Kickstart, the above command should be edited to clone your fork, i.e. replace sourcethemes with your GitHub username.\n Initialize the theme:\ncd My_Website git submodule update --init --recursive   Install with ZIP  Download and extract Academic Kickstart Download and extract the Academic theme to the themes/academic/ folder from the above step  Install with RStudio View the guide to installing Academic with RStudio\nQuick start  If you installed on your computer, view your new website by running the following command:\nhugo server  Now visit localhost:1313 and your new Academic powered website will appear. Otherwise, if using Netlify, they will provide you with your URL.\n Read the Quick Start Guide to learn how to add Markdown content, customize your site, and deploy it. For inspiration, refer to the Markdown content which powers the Demo\n Build your site by running the hugo command. Then host it for free using Github Pages or Netlify (refer to the first installation method). Alternatively, copy the generated public/ directory (by FTP, Rsync, etc.) to your production web server (such as a university\u0026rsquo;s hosting service).\n  Updating Feel free to star the project on Github to help keep track of updates and check out the release notes prior to updating your site.\nBefore updating the framework, it is recommended to make a backup of your entire website directory (or at least your themes/academic directory) and record your current version number.\nBy default, Academic is installed as a Git submodule which can be updated by running the following command:\ngit submodule update --remote --merge  Check out the update guide for full instructions and alternative methods.\nFeedback \u0026amp; Contributing Please use the issue tracker to let me know about any bugs or feature requests, or alternatively make a pull request.\nFor support, head over to the Hugo discussion forum.\nLicense Copyright 2016-present George Cushen.\nReleased under the MIT license.\n","date":1461124800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1515819600,"objectID":"279b9966ca9cf3121ce924dca452bb1c","permalink":"https://jessebett.github.io/post/getting-started/","publishdate":"2016-04-20T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/getting-started/","section":"post","summary":"Create a beautifully simple website or blog in under 10 minutes.","tags":["Academic"],"title":"Academic: the website designer for Hugo","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
