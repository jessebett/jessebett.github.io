# Biography

I am a graduate student in [Machine Learning](http://learning.cs.toronto.edu/) at the University of Toronto and the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/).
I am currently pursuing follow-up research to my work on Neural Ordinary Differential Equations, and am generally interested in approximate inference for latent variable models.
My supervisors are Drs. [David Duvenaud](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~duvenaud/) and [Roger Grosse](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rgrosse/).
I am the instructor for [CSC412/2506: Probabilistic Learning and Reasoning](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jessebett/CSC412/).
